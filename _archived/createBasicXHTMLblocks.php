Use <em>a</em> (not <em>an</em>) before words beginning with a pronounced <em>h</em> (a historical event). Words that begin with an unpronounced <em>h</em> are preceded with <em>an</em>: an honor, an heir, etc.</p>",
"abbreviations and acronyms" => "<ul><li>Use standard abbreviations only (consult <em>Webster&#8217;s Collegiate Dictionary</em>); do not create for convenience.</li><li>Do not abbreviate months in body text. When abbreviated in tables and charts, use upper and lowercase, with periods as needed (Jan., Feb., Mar., Apr., May, June, July, Aug., Sept., Oct., Nov., Dec.).</li><li>When space limitations require abbreviation of days of the week, consistency is key (Sun., Mon., Tues., Wed., Thurs., Fri., Sat. <strong>or</strong> Su, M, Tu, W, Th, F, Sa).</li><li>Do not abbreviate states in body text, except in press releases. In lists and tabular material, address blocks, forms, etc., postal abbreviations for states should be used (two capital letters, no periods).</li><li>On first reference, spell out the full, formal title and place the acronym in parentheses after the title: Child Development Institute (CDI). Acronyms may be used in first reference if they are well-known (e.g., GPA, YMCA). Do not use an apostrophe when making acronyms plural (IDs, RAs, ABCs, etc.).</li><li>In general, use periods with abbreviations that appear in lowercase letters (e.g., i.e., a.k.a., etc., p.m., et al., and so on), but do not use periods with abbreviations in full caps or small caps (CEO, BCE, and so on).</li><li>US, USA, UK, and UN may be abbreviated on first reference if necessary, and may be used without periods, except when the abbreviation includes periods in a formal name (U.S. Court of Appeals).</li><li>Do not use periods in abbreviations of academic degrees (BA, MS, PhD, etc.). Set off the degree with commas when the abbreviation follows the name. (John Q. Doe, MD, was appointed chief surgeon.)</li><li>Use periods after initials standing for given names and abbreviations of junior and senior (J.Q. Doe Jr.), and after abbreviations for titles (Mr., Ms., Dr., Sgt., etc.).</li><li>Do not use spaces with an ampersand (Texas A&amp;M, R&amp;D, J&amp;J, etc.).</li><li>BCE (before the common era) and CE (current era) are preferred to BC (before Christ) and AD (<em>anno Domini</em>, in the year of the Lord), and should appear in all caps, with no periods.</li><li>When an abbreviation that takes a period ends a sentence, no additional period follows; i.e. no double period. (The event was funded by Jones Co. Ltd.)</li></ul>",
"about, approximately" => "<p>When possible, use <em>about</em> instead of <em>approximately</em>. In the sciences, however, <em>approximately</em> is preferred.

"academic degrees" => "<ul><li>Capitalize formal names of academic degrees (Master of Arts in Education), but lowercase informal names (master&#8217;s degree in education).

See the entry <em>degrees</em> for undergraduate and graduate degrees granted by Sarah Lawrence, or reference the appendices.</li><li>On first reference, identify all alumni who appear in College publications by class year and, in most cases, include graduate degree(s) from Sarah Lawrence only. Then drop the year and degree in subsequent references. If the alum prefers that we not include the class year at all, be sure to use an identifier as appropriate (alumna, graduate, etc.).</li><li>Do not include an alumna&#8217;s maiden name unless she commonly uses it. Exception: <em>Sarah Lawrence</em> magazine class notes.</li><li>The two-digit class year that follows the name indicates the year the student earned a BA degree from Sarah Lawrence. (The only exception is for CCE students, who may opt to use a class year that reflects an earlier time they attended SLC.) For graduate degrees, insert the degree abbreviation before (not after) the year.</li><li>For undergraduate degrees, no comma is needed between the name and class year (Jane Allison Doe &#8217;07). The only punctuation is a single close quote (apostrophe), with the tail facing left (away from the numbers).</li><li>Graduate degree abbreviations should follow the name with no comma separating the abbreviation and the graduation year (Jane Allison Doe MFA &#8217;10).</li><li>Undergraduate and graduate degrees should be separated with a comma after the undergrad year (Jane Allison Doe &#8217;07, MFA &#8217;10).</li><li>In cases where a degree is earned elsewhere and there is no Sarah Lawrence graduation year, set off the abbreviation with commas when it follows the name. (John Q. Doe, MD, was appointed chief surgeon. Jane K. Doe, PhD, will be the keynote speaker. Jennifer S.

In such street addresses, use periods with single-letter abbreviations (999 E. Prospect Avenue), no periods with two-letter abbreviations (123 NW Summer Street). Do not set off with commas before or after the street name.</li><li>However, when a direction is the name or part of the name of a street or town itself, it should never be abbreviated (Northwest Highway, South Shore Drive, West Bend, East Orange).</li><li>If space is limited, use abbreviations for street (St.), avenue (Ave.), boulevard (Blvd.), terrace (Terr.), building (Bldg.), and suite (Ste.). Use Rt. for highway references, but Rte. for mail delivery routes (or RR for rural route). If possible, do not abbreviate circle, court, lane, place, road, room, or square. Rather than spell out <em>post office box</em>, use PO Box (no periods); do not use POB.</li><li>Always spell out state names in running text (except DC), but use postal codes for states (two letters, no periods) in lists and tabular material, address blocks, forms, etc., (NY <em>not</em> N.Y.). Separate city and state with a comma.</li></ul>",

In ideal circumstances, the typesetter/designer can open the letterspacing of the three periods slightly for a more aesthetic treatment, but this must be done consistently within a given piece. <ul><li>He presented her the award. &#8230; She began to cry.</li><li>Why was she so excited? &#8230; She couldn&#8217;t imagine what opportunities might lie ahead.</li></ul></li><li>Other punctuation (comma, colon, semicolon, question mark, or exclamation point) may precede or follow the ellipsis. Placement of the other punctuation depends on whether the omitted material precedes or follows the mark in the original text.</li><li>After any complete sentence, be sure to use closing punctuation before the ellipsis.</li><li>The first word after an ellipsis is capitalized if it begins a grammatically complete sentence, even if it was lowercased in the original.</li><li>Keep the three periods together on the same line, but any preceding punctuation may appear at the end of the line above.</li><li>The omission of one or more paragraphs within a lengthy quotation is indicated by an ellipsis at the end of the paragraph preceding the omitted part. If the first part of a paragraph is omitted within a quotation, a paragraph indentation and an ellipsis appear before the first quoted word. So in some cases, this may mean that an ellipsis appears both at the end of one paragraph and at the beginning of the next.</li></ul><p><em>Note:</em> An ellipsis also may be used for dramatic effect, particularly in ads and brochures. An ellipsis can indicate that text will continue elsewhere, that a thought or comment has been interrupted, or that the conclusion of the thought is left open to interpretation. In similar contexts, an ellipsis can be used at the beginning of text to indicate that the copy following is the continuation of earlier text or the completion of an interrupted thought.</p>",
"e-mail" => "<p><em>E-mail</em> may be used as a verb as well as a noun and an adjective. Hyphenate <em>e-mail</em> in all uses. Lowercase <em>mail</em> in all cases, and lowercase <em>e</em> except when used in a headline, on a form, or at the beginning of a sentence (E-mail). Do not italicize e-mail addresses in essay text.

(&#8220;I assure you,&#8221; she began, but he cut her off abruptly.)</li><li>A question mark or an exclamation point may precede an em dash in a sentence, but not a comma, colon, semicolon, or period. (Suddenly the customer&#8212;was he crazy?&#8212;struck the cashier in the face. If you have more trouble&#8212;heaven forbid!&#8212;call me immediately.)</li><li>An em dash may also be used before a name (no space) that follows a quote or quotation.</li></ul><p><em>Note:</em> A 2-em dash is used to represent a missing word or part of a word (to disguise a name, omit an expletive, and so on). When a whole word is missing, spaces appear on both sides of the dash.

(Jane Doe, 1950&#8211;)</li><li>Note that a hyphen, not an en dash, is used to separate numbers that are <em>not</em> inclusive, such as telephone numbers, social security numbers, and ISBNs.</li><li>Additionally, an en dash is often used in place of a hyphen in a compound adjective for clarity (the post&#8211;World War II years, a nursing home&#8211;home care policy, his fly-by-night&#8211;devil-may-care style, etc.)</li><li>An en dash is also used when formatting sports scores and voting tallies.</li><li>Occasionally, an en dash is used to link a city name to the name of a university that has more than one campus, rather than a comma. Follow the institution&#8217;s preference.</li></ul>",

However, foreign proper nouns are not italicized in an English context, nor are foreign words and phrases familiar to most readers and listed in <em>Webster</em>&#8217;s (such as <em>in vitro</em>, <em>eros</em>, and <em>agape</em>). If a foreign word is used repeatedly, it need be italicized only on its first occurrence.</li><li>When a word or phrase is not used functionally but is referred to as the word or term itself, it should be italicized.

However, divisions higher than genus&#8212;phylum, class, order, and family&#8212;are capitalized but not italicized.</li><li>If italicized terms are used in the plural, the <em>s</em> is normally set in roman. A title already in plural form, however, is left unchanged. (Piled on his coffee table were three <em>Chicago Tribune</em>s, four <em>New York Times</em>, and two <em>Madame Bovary</em>s.)

"lists" => "<p>Formatting:</p><ul><li>In running text, short, simple lists are usually better run in the context of the sentence, especially if the introduction and the items form a complete sentence. However, a list should be set vertically if it is lengthy, needs to be prominent, contains items of several levels, or consists of complete sentences (or several). Vertical lists are also helpful when preparing ads, brochures, and other materials where quick and easy readability is important.</li><li>When preparing lists, either in vertical style or run-in style (within a sentence), start by creating parallel grammatical structure for all the elements of the list. Also use consistent formatting throughout a given article, publication, or series of related pieces.</li></ul><p>Run-In Lists:</p><ul><li>As an exception to <em>Chicago</em>&#8217;s style, lowercase letters or numerals that indicate divisions in a list within a sentence are followed by a closing parenthesis only&#8212;not enclosed in full parentheses.</li><li>No punctuation precedes the list if the last word of the introductory material is a verb or a preposition. If the introductory material is an independent clause, however, a colon should precede the list.</li><li>The items in the list are separated by commas unless any of the items require internal commas, in which case the list items should be separated by semicolons.</li></ul><p>Vertical Lists:</p><ul><li><em>When a vertical list is introduced by a complete grammatical sentence</em>, the introductory sentence is followed by a colon (or in some cases a period). Items in the list do not require closing punctuation unless they consist of complete sentences.</li><li><em>When a vertical list</em> <em>completes the introductory sentence</em>, it is recommended that a colon still precede the list. Where the items are simple, commas may be used at the end of each, with a period at the end of the last item. Where one or more of the items contains internal punctuation, semicolons may be used at the end of each item, with a period at the end of the last item. A conjunction (<em>and, or,</em> etc.) may be used after the comma or semicolon at the end of the second-to-last item, but is not required.</li><li><em>When items in the list are numbered</em>, a period follows the initial numeral or letter, and the numerals and letters are aligned by the period. If the items in the list are complete sentences, the text following the period begins with a capital letter. If the items in the list are not complete sentences, or the items in the list complete the introductory sentence, then the text following the period begins with a lowercase letter.</li><li><em>When items run to two or more lines</em> in a list with extra line spacing between the items, the lines should all align with the first word following the enumerating number or letter.

When a fraction is not a single quantity, it is spelled out but not hyphenated. (We cut the cake into four quarters, and John ended up eating three quarters.)

Limited exceptions may be made in lists, ads, etc. as necessary.</li><li>While poems are normally enclosed in quotation marks, a very long poetic work, especially one constituting a book, is italicized instead. And where many poems are mentioned, it is usually better to set all their titles in italics.</li><li>If italicized terms are used in the plural, the <em>s</em> is normally set in roman. A title already in plural form, however, is left unchanged. (Piled on his coffee table were three <em>Chicago</em> <em>Tribune</em>s, four <em>New York Times</em>, and two <em>Madame Bovary</em>s.) This same principle applies to possessives (<em>Atlantic Monthly</em>&#8217;s editor).</li><li>However, in press releases, names of books, operas, television series, movies, recordings, magazines, works of art, and newspaper or magazine columns are put in quotation marks (rather than risk losing the style formatting in transmission/translation).</li></ul><p><strong>Quotation Marks:</strong></p><ul><li>Use quotation marks around the titles of photographs, poems, songs, articles, short stories, essays, chapters, television episodes, speeches, and the names of computer games (but not standard software names), as well as full course titles, seminar titles, conference titles, dissertations, and theses.</li><li>However, a very long poetic work, especially one constituting a book, is italicized and not enclosed in quotation marks.

When the name of a newspaper or periodical is part of the name of a building, organization, prize, or the like, it is not italicized (Los Angeles Times Book Award).</li></ul><p><strong>Musical Works:</strong></p><ul><li>Operas, oratorios, tone poems, and other long musical compositions are italicized. Titles of songs are enclosed in quotations marks. However, instrumental works known by their generic names are not italicized or enclosed in quotation marks (Bach&#8217;s Mass in B Minor, Piano Sonata no. 2, etc.).

A longer notice is better treated as a quotation, especially when it is in the form of a complete sentence.</li></ul><p><strong>Quoting a Title:</strong></p><ul><li>When quoting a title, its original spelling, hyphenation, and punctuation should be preserved, regardless of the style used in the surrounding text. Capitalization should also be preserved, although all cap titles may be reset in upper and lower case. An ampersand may be changed to <em>and</em>, and vice versa, if needed for consistency. Also, numerals may be spelled out, and spelled out numbers may be changed to numerals, for consistent style.</li></ul><p><strong>Book Series and Editions:</strong></p><ul><li>Quoted titles of book <em>series</em> and <em>editions</em> are capitalized but not italicized.

The generic term (such as <em>lake</em>) is also capitalized when used as part of a single name (Walden Pond, the Bering Strait, the Great Barrier Reef).</li><li>In the plural, the generic term is capitalized when it precedes both names (Lakes Michigan and Erie), but lowercased when it comes after (the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, the Illinois and Chicago rivers).</li><li>When a generic term is used descriptively or alone, rather than as part of a name, it is lowercased (the Amazon basin, the California desert, driving along the scenic Pacific coast). But it is capitalized in references to region (the Pacific Coast).</li></ul>",
"tortuous, torturous" => "<p>What is <em>tortuous</em> is full of twists and turns (a tortuous path through the woods). What is <em>torturous</em> involves torture (torturous rush hour traffic).</p>",
