She specialized in the arts and social history of the 19<sup>th</sup> century, particularly the Victorian Era. She was also an accomplished professional photographer whose work was exhibited in the Barbara Walters Gallery of the Heimbold Visual Arts Center and elsewhere. Dr. Edwards received her graduate degrees at Columbia University. She died in 2014 in her native Australia at age 76.</p>\n<p>In the rapidly shifting marketplace of the visual arts, a thorough understanding of the principles and practices of curation has become increasingly important for undergraduate art history students. In recognition of this, Sarah Lawrence created a pilot program in curatorial studies in 2015 with a seed grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. Students can avail themselves of a variety of courses such as \u201cContemporary Curating: Art / Contexts,\u201d \u201cArt Writing,\u201d and \u201cExhibition as Form,\u201d and have benefited from hands-on participation in curating exhibits at museums and galleries at Sarah Lawrence and elsewhere. The grant from the Edwards Foundation expands the numbers and types of curatorial opportunities open to undergraduates art history students and increases their exposure to the world of exhibition and curation.</p>\n<p>This is the second grant to the College from the Edwards Foundation. Last year, a grant for the studio arts program supported the production of \u201cartists\u2019 books\u201d by Sarah Lawrence undergraduates, who interviewed visiting contemporary artists on campus and in their studios and created attractive books based on each artist\u2019s work and mission. The books are currently on press.</p>\n<p><em>Pictured: Dr. Lee MacCormick Edwards at an exhibit of her work in the Esther Raushenbush Library (2006) | Photo: Chris Taggart</em></p>",

I found that their stories paralleled mine in terms of the gratitude they feel towards Vijay. It was this groundswell of admiration and enthusiasm that gave me the idea. Also, my dear friend Miles Coon had&nbsp;spearheaded a&nbsp;similar scholarship for Tom Lux in 2002. And lastly, when I asked Vijay if he would like it, he said he would be extremely honored and gave me permission to begin the efforts. As you can see, we have had an incredible response!</p>\n<p><strong>How do you feel about Sarah Lawrence?</strong></p>\n<p>I found that when I began Sarah Lawrence's MFA in Poetry in 1999, the professors were of very high caliber and that the community of writers was particularly cohesive and supportive. Some of my best friends in the poetry world are a result of the Sarah Lawrence program and Sarah Lawrence MFA poets have landed books in very prestigious places. I think Ross Gay, for instance, just recently won the National Book Award.</p>\n<p><strong>Tell us a story about Vijay from your time at Sarah Lawrence.</strong></p>\n<p>Vijay numbers among the best teachers I have ever had. He is incredibly knowledgeable about poetry and its history. He wears his intelligence lightly and is very skilled at using it to deepen a student's work. I have watched him work with other students as well, and he always approaches their poems with respect for what they are trying to accomplish. Vijay believed in my work, a bit more, perhaps, than I did at the time, and was extremely helpful and encouraging during my time at Sarah Lawrence.</p>\n<p>I remember my first conference with Vijay. We met in an annex bridge-type structure constructed from fieldstone. It had the feel of an old castle or fortress. I had given Vijay a manila envelope of my earlier poems, as he had wanted to get a sense of my work. I was a bit nervous on entering his office, but the first thing he said to me, with a big smile, was, \u201cI had no idea how far along you were. These are really strong and I want to help.\u201d</p>",

I found that their stories paralleled mine in terms of the gratitude they feel towards Vijay. It was this groundswell of admiration and enthusiasm that gave me the idea. Also, my dear friend Miles Coon had&nbsp;spearheaded a&nbsp;similar scholarship for Tom Lux in 2002. And lastly, when I asked Vijay if he would like it, he said he would be extremely honored and gave me permission to begin the efforts. As you can see, we have had an incredible response!</p>\n<p><strong>How do you feel about Sarah Lawrence?</strong></p>\n<p>I found that when I began Sarah Lawrence's MFA in Poetry in 1999, the professors were of very high caliber and that the community of writers was particularly cohesive and supportive. Some of my best friends in the poetry world are a result of the Sarah Lawrence program and Sarah Lawrence MFA poets have landed books in very prestigious places. I think Ross Gay, for instance, just recently won the National Book Award.</p>\n<p><strong>Tell us a story about Vijay from your time at Sarah Lawrence.</strong></p>\n<p>Vijay numbers among the best teachers I have ever had. He is incredibly knowledgeable about poetry and its history. He wears his intelligence lightly and is very skilled at using it to deepen a student's work. I have watched him work with other students as well, and he always approaches their poems with respect for what they are trying to accomplish. Vijay believed in my work, a bit more, perhaps, than I did at the time, and was extremely helpful and encouraging during my time at Sarah Lawrence.</p>\n<p>I remember my first conference with Vijay. We met in an annex bridge-type structure constructed from fieldstone. It had the feel of an old castle or fortress. I had given Vijay a manila envelope of my earlier poems, as he had wanted to get a sense of my work. I was a bit nervous on entering his office, but the first thing he said to me, with a big smile, was, \u201cI had no idea how far along you were. These are really strong and I want to help.\u201d</p>",

It builds on its small but rigorous science curriculum, including its 14-year old summer science research program.</p>\n<p><!--more-->The centerpiece of the endowed fund will be a new program providing stipend support for summer externships for selected undergraduate students who have excelled in the sciences and begun significant research on campus.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis gift is transformational for Sarah Lawrence,\u201d says Dean of the College Kanwal Singh. \u201cWhile the College is well known for the arts and humanities, our pedagogy, which gives students research experience from day one, is also particularly well suited for the sciences.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe new program will allow us to fund more students to do research on campus and progress into the externships in laboratories at major hospitals, research organizations, educational institutions, and companies that are concentrated in the New York area,\u201d says Dean Singh.</p>\n<p>\u201cTaking advantage of our location and these research opportunities will enable our program to grow and to become more competitive with other liberal arts colleges known for the sciences,\u201d she says. \u201cOne of the features that distinguishes our research program from those offered at most universities is the fact that students are directly engaged with faculty members on their projects instead of shadowing a post-doc or grad student, so our undergraduate students are an integral part of the research process.\u201d</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sarahlawrence.edu/faculty/cressman-drew-e..html\">Drew Cressman</a>, member of the biology faculty and head of the summer research program, says that the advanced research opportunities that will open up as a result of this funding will enhance the ability of Sarah Lawrence students to gain acceptance in prestigious PhD programs in the sciences and to obtain post-college employment in science research and technical institutions.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is so exciting about creating this endowment,\u201d claims Ms. Arkin, a Sarah Lawrence alumna, \u201cis that it will make it even more likely that someday a Sarah Lawrence graduate will win the Nobel Prize in science.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ms. Arkin was inspired to make this donation by the work of her oldest son, a leading international authority on microbial biology and biotechnology.</p>",

He lives in Manhattan with his wife Ellen Levy, a professor of literature in Pratt&rsquo;s department of Humanities and Media Studies. When not working, the couple enjoys cooking, wine, travel, and everything that New York City has to offer.</p>\n<p>Horowitz and Levy made donations to <em>The Fund for Sarah Lawrence</em> for many years, but decided to support the College in a more robust way after a meeting with President Karen Lawrence. They admired her leadership in thinking about the liberal arts, and were impressed with the College&rsquo;s newly developed assessment tool for student learning. They also share President Lawrence&rsquo;s opinions about the importance of scholarships and financial aid.</p>\nMr. Horowitz explains: &ldquo;Ellen and I care deeply about providing young people, particularly first-generation students, access to a liberal arts education. This has long been one of our leading causes. It is critically important to the health of higher education that fresh perspectives are part of the conversation. It is also crucial to the health of our democracy that access to the best education be fairly distributed. Ellen is a native of Detroit and lived through its tragic decline. It has a large population of potential first-generation college students and, by establishing the scholarship, we wish to give back and help students who might one day be able to give back to their communities in turn.&rdquo;",

I had an unusual learning style, and even after I switched direction from filmmaking to philosophy, I wanted to blend my philosophical fascinations with careful study of the arts.
